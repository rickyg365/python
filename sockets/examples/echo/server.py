    # Becasue socket.socket() creates a socket object that supports the context manager type, so you can use it in a with statement. Thereâ€™s no need to call s.close():
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
        s.bind((HOST, PORT))
        s.listen()

        conn, addr = s.accept()  # Blocks and provides new socket
